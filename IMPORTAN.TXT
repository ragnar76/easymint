This text references to version 1.7x of EasyMiNT. With version 1.7 
support for kernel 1.15 is suspended, so if you want to install 
the 1.15 freemint kernel you have to use version 1.6x, but this 
version lacks full ARAnyM support.
I will not support version 1.63 anymore, because I have enough to do 
with one version to support.

1. Copyright

	ATTENTION!
	It seems that not all EasyMiNT users have get, that EasyMiNT 
	is Emailware!
	That means, everybody who uses EasyMiNT have to send an email 
	to me, also when everything works fine, if you don't do that, 
	you're working with an illegal copy!

2. Requirements

	It is very recommended to have a look at the FAQ (also the 
	NEWS), because there are described and solved many common 
	problems.

	Please deactivate all AUTO folder or autostart programs 
	during installation process of EasyMiNT, activate them one by 
	one, when installation has finished!
	Do not install EasyMiNT over an old MiNT installation, this 
	will cause problems, too!

	The only harddisk drivers that will work are HDDriver and 
	CBHD (only SCSI disks) because they have the latest XHDI 
	specifications, AHDI for example will not work!
	ARAnyM with EmuTOS will work, too.

	Attention!!
	Rootsector and Bootsector write protection from HDDriver must 
	be turned off on ext2 partition!!!

3. Files

	EasyMiNT Distribution comes with the following archives:

	The following archives are needed:

	EM_x_x.ZIP	- 	EasyMiNT installation program
	EASYMINT.ZIP 	-	Kernel, Driver s, etc.
	ROOTFS.TGZ  	-	Root filesystem
	BASIC.TAR 	-	Rudimentary  MiNT system

	Minimum is  to install the BASIC package, because 'Login' is 
	only possible when this package is installed, but you can 
	start the system by loading an AES (N.AES, XaAES). If you 
 	install only the packages above you will get some error 
	messages during boot process, but you can ignore them so far. 
	They will disappear when you install the STANDARD package, 
	too.

	These packages are optional:

	STANDARD.TAR	-	Extended basic package
	NET.TAR		-	Network package
	DEVEL.TAR	-	Development package
	LIBS.TAR	-	Libraries package
	X11.TAR		-	X11 package

	You have to install the above packages in the above order, 
	because they depending on each other, so when you want to 
	install the development package you have to install net 
	package first!!

	Since version 1.4 it's possible to start EasyMiNT from CD, 
	but you have to keep the file and folder structure you 
	can see below, otherwise EasyMiNT will not work	correctly! 
	(Sometimes starting from CD does not work, but I have not figured 
	out yet, what the problem is)

	If you don't want to download those fat .TAR packages you can 
	download the single rpm packages from Sparemint homepage and 
	pack them together under their corresponding names. Which rpm 
	packages are in which .tgz package, you can see in the .LST 
	files you will find in EASYMINT\PAKETE, do not change these 
	files, except you're know what you're doing!
	Since version 1.5 it is possible to install the rpms without 
	the TAR packages, all you have to do is to download the rpm 
	packages you want and put them in a directory (which supports 
	long filenames!) EasyMiNT will ask during installation for 
	the place and install them with the information it gets from 
	the LST files, so, if you know what you are doing, you can 
	create your own LST files and install the rpms with EasyMiNT. 
	Don't care about whether a package is installed or not, rpm 
	is intelligent enough to know that. But the BASIC.TAR have to 
	be installed always!!

	The archive EM_xxx.zip includes all relevant files and 
	folders, you only have to copy the TAR packages to the 
	EASYMINT\PAKETE folder. If you want to use another language, 
	just copy the RSC and LNG file to the directory where 
	EASYMINT.PRG resides.
	If you want other languages, than the included, don't be shy 
	and translate RSC and LNG file, if you need help by doing 
	that, ask me.


	XaAES/TeraDesk installation

	All you need is included, since version 1.7 XaAES/Teradesk is 
	started in the second installation stage, this makes the second 
	installation step more stable, because MiNT does not run below
	the SingleTOS desktop.


4. Summary

	Finally some comments about the files and folders EasyMiNT 
	creates during installation. First there's the folder 
	C:\EASYMINT\TMP, in this folder you will find various files, 
	most important file is POSITION.TMP. If this file does not 
	exist, EasyMiNT starts with the first installation step, if 
	this file exists it starts with second step. Furthermore the 
	drive letters of the bootdrive and the ext2 partition are 
	stored in this file. The other files in C:\EASYMINT\TMP are 
	self explanatory and they can be safely deleted after 
	installation.
	EasyMiNT will create also files with extension .CHK in the 
	C:\EASYMINT\TMP folder, if these files exists, EasyMiNT 
	"knows" which packages are already installed, this is 
	important if you want to install more packages later.
	You will also find all kernel and device drivers in 
	C:\EASYMINT, if you don't need them anymore, you can safely 
	delete them.


	Have fun!
