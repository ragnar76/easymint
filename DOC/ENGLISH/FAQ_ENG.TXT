The EasyMiNT FAQ

Q1: Is EasyMiNT free?
A: Yes, but the author expects that every user sends an email, 
everyone who don't do this, is an antisocial subject for me.;-)


Q2: I have only a modem with 1200 Baud, how can I get EasyMiNT 
without smashing my phone bill?
A: You can send a CD-R with a return postage to the author and he 
will burn a CD for you.


Q3: What shall I do when nothing works?
First of all read the IMPORTAN.TXT, if it doesn't work either, read 
the IMPORTAN.TXT, if, after that it does not work, ask yourself, have 
I read the IMPORTAN.TXT. Only after doing the above, send an email to 
makehr@ndh.net and ask your question.:)


Q4: I have installed BASIC and STANDARD package and EasyMiNT 
installation is running fine, now I want to post install more 
packages, but installation process was very short and nothing were 
installed.
A: Update EasyMiNT >=1.351


Q5: I have made an LNX partition with HDDriver, but EasyMiNT moans it 
cannot find any LNX partition, what's going wrong?
A: Probably you're using a HDDriver version < 8, in this versions you 
have to enable the LNX support by hand, go to Settings menu -> 
Advance -> More XHDI partition types ___ ___ ___ and enter LNX to one 
of the three fields. (I don't know if the menu names are right, 
because I only have a german HDDRiver version)


Q6: The root filesystem isn't installed.
A: Disable Boot and Rootsector write protection in HDDriver!!


Q7: Why are programs like inetd and portmap aren't installed?
A: These programs make it possible that someone could get access from 
outside to your computer, so they have to be configured very proper. 
These programs should only be installed from experienced 
users!


Q8: On every boot I get the message that a filesystem check should be 
done, why?
A: You didn't shutdown your system properly, always use the shutdown 
program from Draco that is delivered with EasyMiNT to shutdown your 
computer!


Q9: Which packages I have to install?
A: The BASIC package have to be installed, because without it, the 
system does not start!! It's recommended to install the STANDARD 
package, too, because only when this is installed the error messages 
will disappear during boot and you get a clean MiNT setup.


Q10: I'd like to install other rpm archives that are not included in 
EasyMiNT, how does this work?
A: In directory /usr/doc/HOWTO/ you will find a file RPM_HOWTO which 
describes the most options of rpm.


Q11: Installation seems to be successful, but when system should 
start, I get the following error message:

u:\x\mint\bin\fscheck.sh: fsck.ext2 command not found
FATAL: couldn't run u:\sbin\init
exit code: -33
System halted

A: Probably the LST files were not in the folder PAKETE\, copy the 
corresponding LST files to this folder and start installation step 
two, again.
Another possible reason is, that the rootfile system and because of 
that the rest of the packages aren't installed. Look at Q5 and Q6.

Q12: I have installed EasyMiNT successfully and selected XaAES to be 
started, now I want to use N.AES, how can I handle it, that N.AES is 
started instead of XaAES?

A: First you have to create a link onto n.aesxxx.sys, this works like 
this:

bash 2.05# ln -s /c/where_my_naes.sys_is/naes.sys /usr/bin/n_aes

Now you should find a "file" n_aes in /usr/bin. After that you have 
to edit the /etc/ttytab file with an unix compatible text editor 
(like qed or vi). You have to comment the line where /usr/bin/xaaes 
resists and uncomment the line with /usr/bin/n_aes. After reset the 
system should come up with N.AES (if it's configurated correctly)


Q13: I have installed EasyMiNT only with "Login", but after the 
system has started I don't have a cursor, what's going wrong?

A: You may have NVDI installed, which has a bug, that let's the 
cursor disappear, there's no other soultion, than deinstalling NVDI, 
some users reports that it works with virtual consoles, but I don't 
have tested this.


Q14: I got an error when EasyMiNT tries to install the m4 package.

A: Seems to be a problem with the m4 package, not with EasyMiNT


Q15: I have choosed DHCP during network configuration, but I can't get 
internet connection.

A: Possibly your router cannot handle the DNS querys, so you have to edit 
the u:\etc\resolv.conf file and put a nameserver to it.
