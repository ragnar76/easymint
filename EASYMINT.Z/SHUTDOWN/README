Latest changes are listed at the end of this file.

This is my little shutdown program. It operates less or more the same 
way as the Unix one does, with two significant exceptions:

- the Unix-style shutdown writes wtmp, which shutdown.app does not.
- the shutdown.app shuts down GEM applications, which Unix one does not.

The first version of the shutdown.app did NOT use the AES 4.10/N.AES 
shutdown protocol, but a simplified one. However, there were problems 
with some programs (notably: CAB), which apparently do not like 
AC_CLOSE message, when running as applications :-)

Anyways, this version of shutdown.app closes GEM applications and 
accessories using the AES 4.10 shutdown protocol. When a program 
refuses the AP_TERM message, it is sent SIGTERM. If it does not help, 
the situation gets improved with SIGKILL sent subsequently. Messages 
indicating that the shutdown was explicitly rejected by an 
application, are not (NOT!) taken into account.

After this is done, an attempt is made to execute the command 
"/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown", if such a file (/etc/rc.shutdown) is 
known to exist. Here is an example of an rc.shutdown file:

# rc.shutdown
# Carry a random seed from shut-down to start-up
# Save 512 bytes, which is the size of the entropy pool

echo "Saving random seed..."
random_seed=/var/run/random-seed
dd if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1
chmod 600 $random_seed
exit 0

# end of rc.shutdown

Standard handles stdout and stderr are redirected to /dev/null while 
executing the script, so you DON'T see any text output from it.

After that, finally, Shutdown() is called.

CAUTION: the "Cold boot" option uses the extended Shutdown() call 
from FreeMiNT 1.15.4 and up. On older versions this will simply 
perform a warm start.

4.V.2000
--------
- buttons should now look better, when disabled.
- fix in stdout/stderr redirection for the script execution.

15.IV.2000
----------
- the stack size is encoded as a constant field within the 
  shutdown.app executable. First, you find the NULL terminated string 
  saying "½ Draco" (7 characters plus NULL). The next longword should 
  contain $25091973. If so, the yet next longword contains the stack 
  size.

12.IV.2000
----------
- size optimization inside the linked library

6.IV.2000
---------
- when the argument --nowait is passed in the command string, the 
  default action is taken immediately, without an interaction with 
  the user.
- alternatively, the same argument can be passed as a value of 
  $SDMASTER_ARGS.
- this argument is only taken into account when the program is run 
  with root privileges.

31.III.2000
-----------
- if invoked without root privileges, it now disables all the options 
  except the "Quit GEM".

8.II.2000
---------
- smaller startup code linked

26.I.2000
---------
- updates and bugfixes in the linked GEM library

6.I.2000
--------
- on program termination the current settings will be written into 
  the file $HOME/shutdown.inf and read from there at next program 
  startup.
- small changes relative to that (Pdomain(1) added and so on)
- adjustments for current version of GEM libs linked (which changed 
  by the time a bit :-))

Have fun,
